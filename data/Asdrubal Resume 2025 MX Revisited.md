# ASDRÚBAL CHIRINOS
Vision Architect | Bridging Business and Code for Success.

## About me

With over 30 years of experience, I have dedicated my career to bridging the gap between business vision and technical execution. As a Solution Architect and Vision Facilitator, my mission is to help build bridges between visionaries and doers to turn bold ideas into reality.

I specialize in translating high-level objectives into actionable technology roadmaps that align cross-functional teams. By leveraging my background in business strategy, product management, and software development, I work closely with both executive leaders and technical teams to ensure alignment and delivery.
