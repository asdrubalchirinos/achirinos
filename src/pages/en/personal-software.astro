        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            During the early years of personal computing, something
            extraordinary happened. Computers ceased to be tools exclusive to
            specialists and began to amplify people's creative capacity. It
            wasn't just about technology. It was about <strong>control</strong>, <strong
                >intention</strong
            >, and the <strong
                >freedom to create without asking for permission</strong
            >.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Over time, that promise faded.<br />
            Software became complex. Development became professionalized. And most
            people learned to wait. Wait for new features. Wait for solutions. Wait
            for someone else to build what they needed.

            What is Personal Software?
        </h2>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <strong>Personal Software</strong> is a movement that proposes giving
            people back creative control over the tools they use.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            It's not about generic software for millions of users.<br />
            It's about small, specific tools close to real life.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">Personal Software is:</p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6 text-lg">
            <li>Software created to solve a concrete problem.</li>
            <li>Software made by the person living that problem.</li>
            <li>
                Software that prioritizes immediate utility over scalability or
                perfection.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            It's not born for the market.<br />
            It's born for someone.

        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-12 mb-6">
            The Solver, the central figure
        </h2>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Within this movement appears a new figure: <strong
                >the Solver</strong
            >.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The Solver is not defined by knowing how to code or not.<br />
            They are defined by their relationship with the problem they want to solve.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">A Solver:</p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6 text-lg">
            <li>Starts from a real and personal need.</li>
            <li>Clearly defines what they want to solve and why.</li>
            <li>Doesn't wait for a perfect app to exist.</li>
            <li>Decides to build their own solution.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The focus shifts from writing code to <strong>solving</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The Solver doesn't replace the programmer. It changes the center of
            the story.<br />
            Intention becomes more important than syntax.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-12 mb-6">
            Vibe Coding as an enabling practice
        </h2>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The Solver can exist today because there is a new way to create
            software.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Through tools supported by artificial intelligence, the Solver can
            delegate code writing and focus on what really matters:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6 text-lg">
            <li>Defining.</li>
            <li>Prioritizing.</li>
            <li>Adjusting.</li>
            <li>Maintaining closeness to the real problem.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            We call this practice <strong>Vibe Coding</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Vibe Coding is not the goal.<br />
            It is the means.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            It is what allows intention to turn into software without
            unnecessary friction.
        </p>

        <hr class="my-12 border-neutral-200 dark:border-neutral-800" />

        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-12 mb-6">
            An important clarification
        </h2>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            When we talk about focusing on "what really matters," we do so <strong
                >in the context of the problem the Solver wants to solve</strong
            >, not as a denial of the value of code or programming.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Code remains fundamental.<br />
            Programmers remain essential.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The difference is one of level and focus.
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6 text-lg">
            <li>
                The <strong>Coder</strong> optimizes systems, platforms, and infrastructure.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <strong>Solver</strong> optimizes personal, specific, and close-to-home
                solutions.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            They don't replace each other.<br />
            They complement each other.
        </p>

        <hr class="my-12 border-neutral-200 dark:border-neutral-800" />

        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-12 mb-6">Why this movement matters</h2>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Personal Software matters because it changes the relationship
            between people and technology.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            When you don't need to ask for permission, creativity appears.<br />
            When you don't need to know how to program, participation appears.<br
            />
            When you don't need perfection, speed appears.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Technology becomes personal again when it returns to the hands of
            those who need it.
