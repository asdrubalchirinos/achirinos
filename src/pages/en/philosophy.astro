            Throughout our lives, we all face that crucial question: what is our
            mission in life? To be honest, it was only recently that I found the
            way to answer it.

                My mission is to help build bridges between those who dream and
                those who do.

            Although I wasn't always consciously aware of it, this latent
            conviction is what certainly led me into the world of programming.
            The ability to solve problems and bring ideas to life is a challenge
            I have always found exciting and deeply satisfying.

            The Relationship Between Visionaries and Doers
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            While Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are extraordinary examples of the
            relationship between visionaries and those who execute their ideas,
            the reality is much more complex. The key to success lies in an
            authentic and deep connection between vision and execution.

            Synergy Between Vision and Action
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            For a vision to materialize, having a brilliant idea is not enough.
            Those who execute it must be completely convinced, committed, and
            inspired by the dreamer's vision. Without this commitment, they
            won't be able to dedicate all their effort and ability to achieve
            it. On the other hand, the visionary must transmit their reason and
            purpose with passion and clarity. If they fail in this, the idea
            cannot become reality.

        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-12 mb-6">Start with Why</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            A few years ago, I came across Simon Sinek's book <em
                >Start with Why</em
            >. Sinek proposes a simple but profound concept: the Golden Circle.
            This is a framework with three layers: What you do, How you do it,
            and most importantly, Why you do it.

            When I read this for the first time, it clicked immediately. In my
            years as a developer, I always felt the need to go beyond every
            requirement. I couldn't just complete tasks without understanding
            the purpose behind them.

                    I exist to connect those who dream with those who do,
                    specifically between business and development, discovering
                    and amplifying the purpose behind every project.</span

                    true <em>Why</em> of their requirements, and then communicate
                    it with clarity and impact. I work to make that purpose resonate
                    with developers and align everyone around a shared goal.</span
